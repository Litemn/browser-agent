# Browser Agent Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Browser Agent project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality Improvements

[x] Add comprehensive code documentation (KDoc) to all public classes and methods
[x] Implement consistent error handling patterns across all tools
[x] Refactor the BrowserTool class to reduce its size and complexity (Single Responsibility Principle)
[x] Add null safety checks throughout the codebase
[x] Implement proper resource cleanup in all tools (use `use` blocks or similar)
[x] Standardize return values from tool methods for consistency

## Testing Improvements

[ ] Implement unit tests for all core components
[ ] Create integration tests for the agent with mock browser tools
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests for common browser automation scenarios
[ ] Add test coverage reporting to the build process
[ ] Create a test fixture system for browser automation tests
[ ] Implement property-based testing for complex components
[ ] Implement evaluation tests for agent

## Documentation Improvements

[ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions and examples
[ ] Add architecture documentation with component diagrams
[ ] Document all available tools and their capabilities
[ ] Create user guides for common use cases
[ ] Add inline examples for each tool method
[ ] Document error handling and troubleshooting procedures
[ ] Create API documentation with examples
[ ] Add contribution guidelines for external contributors

## Build System Improvements

[ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
[ ] Add static code analysis tools to the build process
[ ] Configure dependency version management
[ ] Implement build caching to improve build times

[ ] Create a simple web UI for monitoring agent activities
[ ] Implement a command-line interface for common operations
[ ] Add support for saving and loading agent state
[ ] Implement a replay system for debugging failed operations
[ ] Add support for custom user scripts
[ ] Create a visual timeline of agent actions


## Architecture Improvements

[x] Implement a modular plugin system for tools to allow easier extension of agent capabilities
[x] Create a clear separation between core agent logic and browser automation implementation
[ ] Develop a configuration management system to handle different environment settings
[ ] Implement a proper dependency injection system to improve testability and flexibility
[ ] Create interfaces for all major components to allow for alternative implementations
